[`write-file-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/gajus/write-file-webpack-plugin).\n\n### `Patterns`\n\nA simple pattern looks like this\n\n```js\n{ from: 'source', to: 'dest' }\n```\n\nOr, in case of just a `from` with the default destination, you can also use a `{String}` as shorthand instead of an `{Object}`\n\n```js\n'source'\n```\n\n|Name|Type|Default|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:-----:|:----------|\n|[`from`](#from)|`{String\\|Object}`|`undefined`|Globs accept [minimatch options](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)|\n|[`fromArgs`](#fromArgs)|`{Object}`|`{ cwd: context }`|See the [`node-glob` options](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#options) in addition to the ones below|\n|[`to`](#to)|`{String\\|Object}`|`undefined`|Output root if `from` is file or dir, resolved glob path if `from` is glob|\n|[`toType`](#toType)|`{String}`|``|[toType Options](#totype)|\n|[`test`](#test)|`{RegExp}`|``|Pattern for extracting elements to be used in `to` templates|\n|[`force`](#force)|`{Boolean}`|`false`|Overwrites files already in `compilation.assets` (usually added by other plugins/loaders)|\n|[`ignore`](#ignore)|`{Array}`|`[]`|Globs to ignore for this pattern|\n|`flatten`|`{Boolean}`|`false`|Removes all directory references and only copies file names.⚠️ If files have the same name, the result is non-deterministic|\n|[`transform`](#transform)|`{Function\\|Promise}`|`(content, path) => content`|Function or Promise that modifies file contents before copying|\n|[`transformPath`](#transformPath)|`{Function\\|Promise}`|`(targetPath, sourcePath) => path`|Function or Promise that modifies file writing
